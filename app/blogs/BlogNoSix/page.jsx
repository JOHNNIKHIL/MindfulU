                </p>
                <p className="mx-4">
                •	Define Priorities: Clearly identify your academic and personal priorities. Understand your goals and allocate time accordingly to strike a balance between academics and social life.
<br />•	Learn to Say No: Practice saying no to commitments that may overwhelm you or conflict with your academic responsibilities. Setting boundaries allows you to manage your time effectively and avoid burnout.

                </p>
                <p className="mx-4">
                •	Plan and Organize: Utilize time management techniques like creating schedules, to-do lists, or using digital apps to plan and organize your academic and social commitments.
<br />•	Allocate Dedicated Time: Set aside specific blocks of time for both academics and social activities. By designating time for socializing, you can enjoy social interactions without neglecting your academic responsibilities.

                <p className="mb-3 mt-3">4.	Fostering Meaningful Connections</p>
                <p className="mx-4">
</p>•	Quality over Quantity: Focus on developing genuine, meaningful connections with a smaller group of friends rather than spreading yourself too thin with superficial relationships.
<br />•	Join Clubs and Organizations: Engage in extracurricular activities and join clubs or organizations aligned with your interests. This provides opportunities to meet like-minded individuals and build connections outside of the academic sphere.
<br />•	Communication and Support: Maintain open lines of communication with your friends, expressing your academic commitments and any challenges you may be facing. True friends will understand and support your goals.

                •	Choose Wisely: Be selective in the social activities you engage in, ensuring they align with your interests and values. Prioritize activities that contribute to your personal growth and well-being.
<br />•	Combine Academics and Socializing: Look for opportunities to combine social activities with academic pursuits. For example, study with friends or form study groups, allowing for both productive learning and social interactions.
